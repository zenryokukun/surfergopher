# 🏄SURFER GOPHER🏄

## ABOUT

Surfer Gopher headed East,  
Hoping one day he would reach the moon.  

Amidst the Pacific, comes a Beast.  
Telling him to go back soon.  

"Your board is headed elsewhere" he said,  
"This path is haunted, you'll regret."  

In despair Surfer Gopher realized,  
His Father's dangerous ambitions.

"No,Father! I am definitely not 'GO'!"  
"You must return the world to us!"
